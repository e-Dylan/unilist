todo

[frontend]

	- connect "data" tab in unidata modal to backend:
		-> make redux reducer store active uni data, initstate data so it doesn't error.
		-> add unidata to rendered html form.

	- feedback form (once data form is done) to add or suggest universities:
		-> allow users to give data for every field
		-> give a name of a missing university
		-> make a form for it, store somewhere (emails?)

	- user scopes when logged in, render specific things.
		-> user account functionality, account button top right?

	- campus map tab in unidata modal
		-> design layout of the tab
